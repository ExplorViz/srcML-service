ANTLR Bug in KeywordCPPLexer.cpp

The file KeywordCPPLexer.cpp is generated by ANTLR from the grammar file KeywordCPPLexer.g.
The current version of ANTLR (2.7.5) creates an unintentional multi-line comment around line 1325.  The
generated comment is:

	// ! $ % & + - / < = > ? \\

It should be:

	// ! $ % & + - / < = > ?

This can be fixed by hand.  The Linux Makefile includes an automatic fix using a simple perl command for this.


Linux Version

The Linux

1) Alter Makefile.antlr for specific configuration for ANTLR libraries

2) ./make

The Makefile for the Linux version is optimized for speed.

Visual Studio Version

There is no unsigned long long type in Visual Studio.  Instead, __int64 can be used.  The Makefile has a special
option "visual" to make the required conversions.

Note that a macro could be used for the type, but not for the literal value extension, e.g., 0x0000000000000000ULL
