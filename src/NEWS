Trunk

	Changed srcml2src to use libxml2.  This allows it to handle the full range
	of XML including CDATA, processing instructions, etc.  It also allows for
	improved handling of XML currently used including XML declarations.  In short,
	it is much more robust, a lot smaller, and almost twice as fast.	

Release of Aug-29-2005-Beta

It has been a long time between releases.  Development continued during that 
time especially with regards to robustness.  In spite of increased robustness,
speed of translation remains over 11,000 LOC/second.

Major New Features

	* There is preliminary support for Java.  It is available using the 
	options "--language Java" or "-l Java".  Most of the common statements
	between Java and C++ work, the import and package statements work, and
	classes work.  	More work needs to be done on testing on large Java
	code bases.

	* Old K&R C function parameter declarations are now handled.  This is 
	only available in C mode under the options "--language C" and "-l C".

	* srcml2src is now available in a Windows build.

There have been some markup changes:

	* A macro statement (a macro with a terminating semicolon) now does not 
	include the semicolon

	* Line comments no longer include the end-of-line character inside of 
	the element

	* Remove initial special newline whitespace after the start element of 
	unit

	* Language attribute on element unit is now always inserted

	* The translator now outputs a default XML declaration.  This allows 
	for proper encoding type to be given and clears up some problems with
	special characters.  An alternate encoding can be specified
	on the command line using the option "--encoding UTF-8 or "-e UTF-8".
	If a blank encoding is specified using the option '--encoding ""' or 
	'-i UTF-8' then no XML declaration is issued.

The debug mode is now more properly integrated:

	* New option for marking translation errors with proper namespace

	* Changed names of error mode elements to "srcmlerr:parse" and 
	"srcmlerr:mode" to better reflect different problems

Translator interface has been improved:

	* Options can now be specified in any order

	* Unrecognized options are properly handled

	* Single options (those without parameters) can be grouped 
	
Extended Mode

	* Hidden extended mode for marking literals "--extended" or "-x"

	* More options will follow
