- Two features for both xslt and xpath on srcml2src:

  --register-ext NAME=XPathExpression
  
  XPathExpression is a string
   

  --register-ext-file FILENAME

  FILENAME of XPathExpressons.

  Both of these may be used multiple times, e.g.,

  srcml2src --register-ext return_expr=".//src:return/src:expr"

  Will need:

    -Arguments
    -Some place to store them

- Tests for src:archive('filename') and other attributes in XSLT (see archive.xsl)

- Split http and ftp callbacks in libxml_archive_read.cpp.  Put in
  separate files.  Eliminate the need for the "if () else ;"

- Combine "urisprefix" with uris:

  - Add field and data
  - Change srcMLTranslator to take uris'
  - Change src2srcml to use uris where urisprefix is being used

- Hande OPTION_SETTINGS.

- How to handle leading "../"

- Compare list of file that tar gets (and order) with what srcML gets:
  - Use --exclude-vcs for tar
  - Do the same for cpio

- Is our --files-from format valid as an mtree format? I.e, do you need anything but the filename?
