- Replace type codes ( *_CODE) for options with ascii numbers starting at 128 (both src2srcml and srcml2src)

- Need OPTION_??? for --settings. Have to wait for all the options to be processed to output the settings

- How to handle leading "../"

- Compare list of file that tar gets (and order) with what srcML gets:
  - Use --exclude-vcs for tar
  - Do the same for cpio

- Is our --files-from format valid as an mtree format? I.e, do you need anything but the filename?

- Combine "urisprefix" with uris:

  - Add field and data
  - Change srcMLTranslator to take uris'
  - Change src2srcml to use uris where urisprefix is being used
